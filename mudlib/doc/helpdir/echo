Usage : echo <text>

The echo command takes the text that you provide and prints it to everyone
in the room.  It is similar to emote except that your name is not prepended
to the text you type.

Examples:

echo A large branch falls of a tree and bounces of Pinkfish's head.

echo You are totally amazed by the resounding THUNK sound it made.

echo A eerie mist passes through the room.
