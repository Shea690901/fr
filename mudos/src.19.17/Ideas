The general solution to error handling is actually quite simple.  I have
thought about adding it, but never got around to it.

  1. A new sub-type of int would be created called ERROR.
  2. A new predicate function would exist called errorp().
  3. All efuns would return an int/error svalue when an error is
     detected during efun processing.
  4. A new mudlib-imported error.h file would exist to define error
     numbers in terms of #defines (the #defines would be used in both
     the driver and mudlib code)
  5. A function (call it perror()) would exist that accepted an error
     wvalue and returned a printable string.
  6. All efuns would be converted to use these new error svalues and
     associated numbers.

All mudlib code that did things that could error out would either:

  data = efun(..);
  if (!data-type-expectedp(data))
    return;

or:

  data = efun(..);
  if (errorp(data))
    return;

return would be replaced with whatever error recovery action would need to
take place in that context.  Errors could then be trated in an integrated
fashion throughout the driver/mudlib.

we need to made a single-user option for MudOS that doesn't use sockets
at all so that people wanting to run MudOS at schools where programs
aren't allowed to listen on socket (anti-mud policies) can use MudOS
for developing LPC code for another mud.

We came up with hopefully a somewhat useful idea to add_action() efun.

Something like:   add_action( string, void|string|string *, void|int );

So that if you do  add_action( "look", ({ "look", "l", "glance" }) );
it will set 'look', 'i', and 'glance' as all possible commands to call
'look' function in the object.  This would shorten code so that you don't
have to do 3 different add_action calls.  What do you think?

It'd be cool if there were efuns like this:

mapping x;

attach_mapping(mapping x, string filename);

detach_mapping(x);

which would attach mapping x to the database named by filename.

any accesses to the mapping x would in fact manipulate the database.

This would work much the way attached mappings work in Perl.

We could use the dbm database code in UNIX(tm).  Only problem is
not all UNIX's have dbm's that support multiple databases per
UNIX process.

I agree; it does seem that we need a variant of call_out that operates in terms
of number of heartbeats rather than absolute # of seconds.  A few ways
to do this.

// optionally change the way call_out() works so that muds can change it if
// they like.
#define CALL_OUT_UNITS_EQUAL_HEARTBEAT /* or some shorter similar thing */

Or we could make a call_out2() efun that operates in the desired heartbeat units
(name it something more appropriate than call_out2()).

1) Have the z command in the editor check the user's PAGER settings.
   ie: getenv("LINES")  much like the mudlib's more command does.  If there
   isn't any setting, you can have it default back to the standard z length.

hmm, save_object() should probably somehow save the subtype of numbers.
(ie null, undefined, error, etc)

Comment: with some of the optimizations lately, the subtype of numbers is
	not always reliable longterm ...

-----

file_length() efun that returns the number of lines in a file

-----

An option for persistent swap files (that the driver can restore/recover
from), saving clones and the contents of variables.

-----

For consistency, we should pass shared or constant strings to
  mudlib_stats.c and uid.c; mudlib_stats currently makes a shared string
  and uid does a string_copy; by using shared strings all round, we can
  use pointer comparison for lookup (faster than strcmp())
Although mudlib_stats uses a linked list, it is fast for insertion; however
  lookup is O(n)...this should be hacked to use an AVL tree, in addition
  to uid.c

#pragma no_inherit
#pragma no_clone

Comment:
    These aren't object flags as first believed...they have to be stored
    in the program structure, so that it can be restored from binaries.
    pragma_no_inherit & pragma_no_clone flags should probably be in
    simulate.c, disjoint from those in lex.c.
        clone_object()
          ob = find_object_no_load()
          if (ob->prog->flags & P_NO_CLONE)
            error("Illegal object to clone\n");

          find_object()
            find_object2() <- avoid calling this again (for performance)
            load_object()

        inheritance: (compiler/grammar & lpc_compiler/grammar)
          ob = find_object2()

          if (ob->prog->flags & P_NO_INHERIT)
             yyerror("Illegal object to inherit\n");

        lex.c
          init pragma_no_inherit
               pragma_no_clone

        compiler/grammar & lpc_compiler/grammar
          set prog flags
