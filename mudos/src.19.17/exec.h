/*
 * A compiled program consists of several data blocks, all allocated
 * contiguously in memory to enhance the working set. During compilation,
 * the blocks will be allocated separately, as the final size is
 * unknown. When compilation is done, the blocks will be copied into
 * the one big area.
 *
 * There are 5 different blocks of information for each program:
 * 1. The program itself. Consists of machine code instructions for a virtual
 *    stack machine. The size of the program must not be bigger than
 *    65535 bytes, as 16 bit pointers are used. Who would ever need a bigger
 *    program :-)
 * 2. Function names. All local functions that has been defined or called,
 *    with the address of the function in the program. Inherited functions
 *    will be found here too, with information of how far up the inherit
 *    chain that the function was defined.
 * 3. String table. All strings used in the program. They are all pointers
 *    into the shared string area. Thus, they are easily found and deallocated
 *    when the object is destructed.
 * 4. Table of variable names. They all point into the shared string table.
 * 5. Line number information. A table which tells at what address every
 *    line belongs to. The table has the same number of entries as the
 *    programs has source lines. This is used at errors, to find out the
 *    line number of the error.  This is usually swapped out to save space.
 *    First entry is the length of the table.
 * 6. List of inherited objects.
 */

/*
 * When a new object inherits from another, all function definitions
 * are copied, and all variable definitions.
 * Flags below can't explicitly declared. Flags that can be declared,
 * are found with TYPE_ below.
 *
 * When an object is compiled with type testing NAME_STRICT_TYPES, all
 * types are saved of the arguments for that function during compilation.
 * If the #pragma save_types is specified, then the types are saved even
 * after compilation, to be used when the object is inherited.
