> This document is an electronic Petition Statement to the
> U.S. Congress regarding pending legislation, the
> "Communications Decency Act of 1995" (S. 314) which will
> have, if passed, very serious negative ramifications for
> freedom of expression on Usenet, the Internet, and all
> electronic networks.  The proposed legislation would remove
> guarantees of privacy and free speech on all electronic
> networks, including the Internet, and may even effectively
> close them down as a medium to exchange ideas and
> information.
>
> This document is somewhat long, but the length is necessary
> to give you sufficient information to make an informed
> decision.  Time is of the essence, we are going to turn
> this petition and the signatures in on 3/16/95, so if you
> are going to sign this please do so ASAP or at least before
> midnight Wednesday, March 15, 1995.
>
> Even if you read this petition after the due date, please
> submit your signature anyway as we expect Congress to
> continue debating these issues in the foreseeable future
> and the more signatures we get, the more influence the
> petition will have on discussion.  And even if Congress
> rejects S. 314 while signatures are being gathered, do
> submit your signature anyway for the same reason.
>
> Please do upload this petition statement as soon as
> possible to any BBS and on-line service in your area.
> If you have access to one of the major national on-line
> services such as CompuServe, Prodigy, AOL, etc., do try
> to upload it there.  We are trying to get at least 5000
> signatures.  Even more signatures are entirely possible
> if we each put in a little effort to inform others, such
> as friends and coworkers, about the importance of this
> petition to electronic freedom of expression.

> ******(2) The Petition Statement
>
> In united voice, we sign this petition against passage of S. 314 (the
> "Communications Decency Act of 1995") for these reasons:
>
> S. 314 would prohibit not only individual speech that is "obscene, lewd,
> lascivious, filthy, or indecent", but would prohibit any provider of
> telecommunications service from carrying such traffic, under threat of
> stiff penalty.  Even aside from the implications for free speech, this
> would cause an undue - and unjust - burden upon operators of the various
> telecommunications services.  In a time when the citizenry and their
> lawmakers alike are calling for and passing "no unfunded mandates" laws
> to the benefit of the states, it is unfortunate that Congress might seek to
> impose unfunded mandates upon businesses that provide the framework for
> the information age.
>
> An additional and important consideration is the technical feasibility of
> requiring the sort of monitoring this bill would necessitate.  The
> financial burden in and of itself - in either manpower or technology to
> handle such monitoring (if even legal under the Electronic Communications
> Privacy Act) - would likely cause many smaller providers to go out of
> business, and most larger providers to seriously curtail their services.
>
> The threat of such penalty alone would result in a chilling effect in the
> telecommunications service community, not only restricting the types of
> speech expressly forbidden by the bill, but creating an environment
> contrary to the Constitutional principles of free speech, press, and
> assembly - principles which entities such as the Internet embody as
> nothing has before.
>
> By comparison, placing the burden for content control upon each individual
> user is surprisingly simple in the online and interactive world, and there
> is no legitimate reason to shift that burden to providers who carry that
> content.  Unlike traditional broadcast media, networked media is
> comparatively easy to screen on the user end - giving the reader, viewer,
> or participant unparalleled control over his or her own information
> environment.  All without impacting or restricting what any other user
> wishes to access.  This makes regulation such as that threatened by this
> S. 314 simply unnecessary.
>
> In addition, during a period of ever-increasing commercial interest in
> arenas such as the Internet, restriction and regulation of content or the
> flow of traffic across the various telecommunications services would have
> serious negative economic effects.  The sort of regulation proposed by this
> bill would slow the explosive growth the Internet has seen, giving the
> business community reason to doubt the medium's commercial appeal.
>
> We ask that the Senate halt any further progress of this bill.  We ask
> that the Senate be an example to Congress as a whole, and to the nation
> at large - to promote the general welfare as stated in the Preamble to
> the Constitution by protecting the free flow of information and ideas
> across all of our telecommunications services.

>           Instructions for Signing This Petition
>           ======================================
>
> It must first be noted that this is a petition, not a
> vote.  By "signing" it you agree with *all* the requests
> made in the petition.  If you do not agree with everything
> in this petition, then your only recourse is to not sign
> it.
>
> In addition, all e-mail signatures will be submitted to
> Congress, the President of the United States, and the
> news media.
>
> Including your full name is optional, but *very highly
> encouraged* as that would add to the effectiveness of the
> petition.  Signing via an anonymous remailer is highly
> discouraged, but not forbidden, as an attempt will be made
> to separately tally signatures from anonymous remailers.
>
> Because this is a Petition to the U.S. Congress, we ask
> that you state, as instructed below, whether or not you
> are a U.S. citizen.  We do encourage non-U.S. citizens to
> sign, but their signatures will be tallied separately.
>
> Signing this petition is not hard, but to make sure your
> signature is not lost or miscounted, please follow these
> directions EXACTLY:
>
> 1) Prepare an e-mail message.  In the main body (NOT the
> Subject line) of your e-mail include the ONE-LINE statement:
>
> SIGNED <Internet e-mail address> <Full name> <US Citizen>
>
> You need not include the "<" and ">" characters. 'SIGNED'
> should be capitalized.  As stated above, your full name is
> optional, but highly recommended.  If you do supply your
> name, please don't use a pseudonym or nickname, or your
> first name -- it's better to just leave it blank if it's
> not your full and real name.  If you are a U.S. citizen,
> please include at the end of the signature line a 'YES',
> and if you are not, a 'NO'.  All signatures will be
> tallied whether or not you are a U.S. Citizen
>
> ****************************************************
> Example: My e-mail signature would be:
>
> SIGNED dave@kachina.altadena.ca.us Dave C. Hayes YES
> ****************************************************
>
> 2) Please DON'T include a copy of this petition, nor any
> other text, in your e-mail message.  If you have comments
> to make, send e-mail to me personally, and NOT to the
> special petition e-mail signature address.
>
> 3) Send your e-mail message containing your signature to
> the following Internet e-mail address and NOT to me:

>               ===========================
>                 s314-petition@netcom.com
>               ===========================
>
> 4) Within a few days of receipt of your signature, an
> automated acknowledgment will be e-mailed to you for e-mail
> address verification purposes.  You do not need to respond or
> reply to this acknowledgement when you receive it.  We may
> also contact you again in the future should we need more
> information, such as who your House Representative and
> Senators are, which is not asked here as it is unclear
> whether such information is needed.
