        -- * This is the simple FAQ for the Final Realms MUD. * --

It will try to answer some of the most usual questions asked to the immortals
on FR. It will be a bit unstructured..:=)


                        -- * Intentions * --


We, the immortals have one goal, that is to make the best roleplaying
environment on the Net. It is as many opinions on this as there are immortals.

Baldrick, is the guy that take the final decision, but not without listening
to the users. Some of it may feel unfair to users, but usually have good
reasons.



     -- * Baldrick's little section: (even more unstructured..) * --


Sometimes you feel that the mud is getting in an unfair direction for your guild
or race. This is usually only temporary, for example does  the new 
spellrestrictions feel very unfair to the mages. But before they were made, the
mages didn't complain, but the fighters. 

Mages will get more spells, it will start to come bracers, rings of protection,
and they will even be able to cast their own enchant spells. This will make 
them more powerful again. But then another guild will complain..:=)

I am still discussing with myself if we shold start a discussion on holding
stuff while casting spells.. But spells will be cut off when a mage is hit
during fights.. (I hope I can be able to let the mages cast spells through 
one exit / room, but that can take a long time to implement). Some spells, 
like finger of death will be touchspells, and then you aren't allowed to carry 
anything with your hands, and you have to hit the victim..

Some of you are surprised with our liberal politics regarding playerkilling (PK)
but this has a reason. If we start to make such rules, you won't get organized
to take care of the morons. It is all up to you to take care of people / NPC's
you don't want in your guild, town, room, pub and so on.

A player asked if I could promote some player guardians, that is not my job.
It is the town council, they should hire guardians, and pay them with taxes
people have to pay for entering the town. You players is responsible for this.
Some guilds have understood the importance of a high council / directorate, 
and so on. They organize guildmasters, newbiehelpers, public relation people, 
and economics.. A well organized guild have a better chance to get new stuff
from the immortals. They can pay for it (with collect, stolen money and so on).

Yes, I know you want more, your hunger for more power and goods is growing,
but that is good and understandable. But we have a lot of work to do, and
we are working on a lot of stuff you will see when new areas open. 

Regarding chatlines;

Some of you are complaining that we don't have global chatlines. We won't 
ever get them either. This is because there is no logical reason for having 
them. Should all people have psionic skills? no. "But you have guild channels
that works the same way?". Yes, but I we have to let a little of it to offer 
playability. We woule like to get rid of them too, or make the high level 
channels for some guilds. But that would make it too hard for the players.

Global tell and shout is also stupid, but we have to compromise between 
roleplaying and playability.

When you want to chat about stuff, visit a pub, they have the Globe of 
pubchatting.

Another thingie that players usually asks for is more information about other
players on 'who' and 'finger', like guild, level and so on. 
This has been removed to maintain a possibility to keep your own strenght a bit
secret, ergo; exiting.


         -- * What can we do to help improving these Realms? * --

 - Ideas:
    
        * Use the command 'idea' to log ideas. This is the preferred method.

        * Mail the mailgroup 'mudlib' for big changes in the gamesystem.

        * Mail the Thane of the domain you want to have something regarding that
          domain.

        * Mail the mailgroup 'spells' for ideas for spells and commands.

  - Bugs:

        * Use the 'bug' command to log bugs.

        * If the bug is severe, mail the groups mentioned above.


              -- * Nice things to know before you start * --

 - Commands:
 
        * 'rearrange': this command will help you arrange your stats.
                       You can use this command only once, so be sure you know
                       what stats you want (usually by knowing wich guild you
                       want to join)

        * 'chfn'     : CHange Finger iNfo, this helps us and the other players
                       get to know who's behind the charachter. And by telling
                       your birthday you get a surprise when you have it..

        * 'describe <description>': This is your best way to make your player-
                                    character more personal and unique.

        * 'retire'   : If you don't want to use this character anymore, this
                       is the preferred way to get rid of the player.
                       Just type retire and then your password and the character
                       is history.

        * 'sheet'    : Gives you most info you need about your character.

        * 'emergency': This is a channel that you can use to reach all immortals
                       invisible or not. BUT it is for emergency calls only.
                       Emergency is it when you are stuck (because of bugs),
                       or something is wrong with you.
                      
                       This is the preferred method to ask for help, the 
                       immortal able to help you will then answer.


 - Dying:

        * Usually there will be a priest with raising abilities in your group
          (party), but there are other ways to get raised when you die.
          All priestly temples have hospitals where you can get raised for an 
          amount of money. Usually it costs one platinum coind per level, but
          when you are level 0 and 1 it is free.

          But you can't carry money when you are dead, so either you have
          someone to pay the money for the raise or you can create an account
          at the different temples, one account for every temple.

          These money will go to the high council for maintenance of the temple.

 - Passowrds:
      
          If you loose your password, shame on you. We can't change the password
          nor won't. This is because we can't be 100% sure it really is you
          or someone else. So, remember you PW or loose the character.
 

               -- * The rules the players have to obey: * --


 - Multiplaying:

        * It is not legal to play more than one playercharacter at a time. 
          But it is legal to have different characters and switch between them,
          but never online at the same time. (sidenote; it's concerned as
          cheating to drop all and then log the other char in and let it use
          the stuff.)

          Multiplaying is considered as cheating and both characters will be
          removed.

 - Finger info:
     
        * It is regarded as polite to have updated finger info. 
                
 - Cheating / bug abusing:
  
        * This is difficult, players should of course not abuse bugs,
          but the bugs should not be there in the first place. 
          Although, abusing bugs and not telling the immortals about them is 
          considered as cheating.

          Cheating -> removing of player file.

 - Profound langugage: 

        * We don't like it, but as long as it's a part of the roleplaying it's 
          ok. But just shouting F*** for the sheer H*** of it is not 
          regarded as smart..:=) We have prisons for players not responding
          to our advice about shutting up....


           -- * Help on Immortality, and how to apply for it. * --

 -  Requirements: 
       * At least two to three days playing the Realms.

       * A Thane willing to let you be in Domain.

       * A Sponsor, this is a Patron or Thane willing to help you with your 
         problems. The Sponsor is also responsible for everything you do.
         (Read: mess it up, and you mess with the Sponsor.)
 
       * Email address in the finger before you apply, can be as admin only (:).

       * Accept the Rules, ('help crerules' will give you the rules.)

 - Apply by gettig your Sponsor to apply for you to the God (forward your
   application). The apply should include:
    
       * Real name.
       * If you are an Immortal on other muds, the muds and your name there. 
       * Experience, as a mudcoder and other programming languages.
       * Knowledge of AD&D. or other roleplaying games.
       * Other relevant stuff.


                      --* Rules for creators *--


 -  Never make things that does not belong in the setting of this mud. 

       * This includes known items/monsters/characters from other worlds even
         if that's also AD&D. Also includes things that we compare with our
         own world. Both in descriptions, as comparisons and otherwise.

       Reason for this rule: If things from other settings pop up the entire
       athmosphere of the game is undermined.

 -  Never make super-things (armours/items/weapons/spells/monsters etc.)
 
       * This includes all things that are not balanced with the rest of the 
         excisting things in the game. This also extends to your private
         use and private directory.

       Reason for this rule: If the game is not balanced the fun for the
       players is greatly reduced, tho they may love to have such items.
       The reasons why you are not allowed to make such items even for your
       own use are that:

         1: The items has a tendency to get into the possession of players
            whether the creator inteded it so or not. Possible reasons are
            that you drop them as you log out or other creators clone them
            and gives them to players (reason for demotion).

         2: Your private directory is open for all to read and clone things
            from, so they may be misused.

         3: When such an item appears in the game there is no question as
            to who cloned it and gave it away. It's simply always the fault
            of the one who made it.


 -  Never help players.

       * This includes giving away money and other things,
         transportig them where they want to go, try to fix bugs that bothers
         them and giving away info that is obviously meant to be hidden. Also
         never CALL functions to raise lower stats/hp/ability scores/gp/etc 
         on players/monsters or to other advantages/disadvantages. This also 
         includes changing their titles/race/etc.

       * This does not include answering questions that they need answers to
         to completely understand something in the game.

       Reason for this rule: Obviously helping players ruins the challenge 
       and fun of the game. If they get things too easily the joy of getting
       it is greatly dimished. Also it feels very unfair to the ones who
       work/play a lot to receive an advantage another has gotten for free.
   
       * What to do instead: Tell any lord what the problem is, and he'll act
         according to what we've agreed upon in PR-meetings. Also he'll know
         how to fix things safely without creating bugs. Examples of this are
         trying to add a level to any skill of a player or changing their
         guilds or race. NEVER do this.


 - Never shout or otherwise spread your bad feelings about others.

       * If there is a problem with either a player or another creator,
         it should be discussed in a lord-meeting. We'll decide what to do
         about it there, and possibly call in the "accuser and guilty" for
         an interview. This includes shouting and chat'ing words that are
         bound to insult people for religious, racial, sexual or other
         similar reasons.

       Reason for this rule. When the creators (the ones people look up to)
       here start spreading ill temper the players are bound to pick up on
       it, and this will make the mud a very unpleasant place to be. Also
       most things we disagree and get angry with each other for are due to
       misunderstandings. After a short discussion most things are settled.

 - Use a guest character for testing.

       *  You're allowed to have ONE character besides your creator-character.
          Use it for adventuring, that means it is a player and all rules
          concerning helping players shall be followed. NO modifying!

       Reason for this rule:  When a player gets hurt due to your actions you
       will not be allowed to reinstate him, and if he gains more benefits than
       you meant to give you'll not be allowed to remove it again.  We need to
       have a common policy in how to rule what should be done in such instances,
       so to keep confusion to a minimum, only lords are allowed to compensate.

       * So, make a guest called 'test' (or similar) and use that one for 
         testing pursposes.


 - Never make thing that kills players without proper warning. 

       * If you make a very powerful monster or a room that is likely to kill
         a player, let them be warned somehow before they're dead.
 
       Reason for this rule:  When players die because of their own stupidity, 
       that is of course fair enough, but if it happens without them having
       ample reason for suspecting a "trap" it ruins the fun of gaming.

 - Give just rewards for actions by the players.

       * If a monster or quest is very easy to complete, don't give huge 
         rewards.  Most monsters shouldn't have any items on them, only the 
         ones that are hard to beat.

       Reason for this rule:  When the game is balanced everything is fun.  When
       you get a big reward for doing just a simple thing the harder quests/
       monsters lose their whole reason for being there.  Players need to feel 
       that they're progressing towards something (the reason for a level system).
       If they get it all from the start, there's nothing to look forward to.

 - Read the docs.

       * The docs provide information on what functions you can use, and some 
         hints to how things are supposed to work.  It will enable you to make
         better code than if you don't read them.

       Reason for this rule:  We have changes and added some function to make
       the game run faster and more smoothly.  If you use ...say 2.4.5 code it
       may work, but not as fast or well as it would using our new functions.
       Also it will help you code things faster and above all in an easier way.
     

 - Don't change your name or set_short.

       Reason for this rule:  You mire the debug logs with errors due to bad
       id's. Also several commands can get corrupted by this.  'who', 'finger'
       and 'people' are examples of commands that always gets ruined.
