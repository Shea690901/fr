Usage : rearrange

Once during a characters life you can rearrange your stats. When you rearrange
your stats you'll be given a base of 8 in all scores, and the remainder will 
be put in a pool for you to distribute as you please. 

Stats will be of the range between 8 and 18/00 normally, just like in AD&D.
Racial adjustment and adjustments because of guilds will come after your
rearranging.

It will be possible to increase this by completing certain quests and by    
imbibing potions however. Just follow the guidelines at the prompts, and
you'll easily be able to arrange the scores as you please. As this can be done
only ONCE I stress the importance of deciding in advance what your character
shall be like when you finish.
