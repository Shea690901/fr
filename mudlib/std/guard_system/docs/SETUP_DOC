Setting up the Guard System

before going any further make sure you have permission to set up
one of these systems.  


what you will need for this system:
- a handler npc (../npcs/handler_npc.c)
- a room for this npc
- a room to recruit the guards in (../rooms/barracks.c)
- one head guard (../npcs/head_guard.c)
- one regular guard (../npcs/reg_guard.c)
- a point system (../handlers/point_system_handler.c)
- a guard object for the player (../handlers/rank_insignia.c)
- assignments (../assignments/ex_assignment.c)

what you need to do is inherit these files and do the appropriate
setting up like you would for any normal room/npc/item.  there are some
differences which are outlined below.

additional setup:
  in the handler_npc.c you will need to initialize the following in
  the setup of your main NPC
  - set_assignments( ({ "array of string filenames of all assignments" }) );
  - set_current_assigns( ({"array of what assignments are called"}) );
  - set_info("string of information on guild");
  - set_paths("path to log dir", "path to assignments dir",
         "path to handlers directory");
  - set_guild_ob("path to ob including filename", "set_name");
  - set_head_guard_name("set_name of head_guard");
  - set_props("guard killer prop name", "quit guard prop name",
         "guard member prop name", "point system prop name");

  in the barracks
  - set_props("guard member prop name", "point system prop name");
  - set_guard_ob_name("set_name");
  - set_paths("path to handlers dir", "path to npcs dir");

  in the head guard
  - set_guard_ob_name, set_props as in barracks
  - set_path("handlers dir");

  in the regular guard
  - set_guard_ob_name("set_name");
  - set_member_prop("guard member prop name");


  in the point system handler
  - set_assignments( ({ "assingment name", "path to assignment" }) );
  - set_bonus_races( ({ "query_race of any race that should get a "
        "bonus in payment for being killed (PCs only)" }) );
  - set_bonus_guilds( ({ "query_guild_name (same as set_bonus_race)" }) );
  - setup_points( ([ mapping (see the point_system_handler for setup) ]) );
  - set_props("guard killer prop name", "guard member prop name",
        "point system prop name");

  in the rank insignia
  - set_member_prop("guard member prop name");
  - set_handler_path("path to handler dir");

  in the assignments
  - see the example assignment for how they should be setup


additional notes:
- head guard must be called guard_sig_sec.c and regular guard must be
  called guard_sig.c (filenames that is)
- make sure all the property names are unique
- be sure to look at how the STFG sets these files up as well


im sure i am forgetting stuff so mail me with any more questions.
