Also includes things that we compare with our   own world. Both in descriptions, as comparisons and otherwise.   Reason for this rule: If things from other settings pop up the entire   athmosphere of the game is undermined.2: NEVER MAKE SUPER-THINGS (armours/items/weapons/spells/monsters etc.)   This includes all things that are not balanced with the rest of the    excisting things in the game. This also extends to your private   use and private directory.   Reason for this rule: If the game is not balanced the fun for the   players is greatly reduced, tho they may love to have such items.   The reasons why you are not allowed to make such items even for your   own use are that:      1: The items has a tendency to get into the possession of players         wheth",})
