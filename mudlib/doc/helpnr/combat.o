nroffed_file ({0,"CombatThe combat system is how you go about killing things.  You and all other livingthings have rules built into you to determine the outcome of fights.  Youcan initiate combat by either typing 'kill <thing>' or by casting an offensivespell at the thing.  You can kill monsters or other players.  Player-killing is not a very good thing to do, and if it happens often and with no good reason:   expect to hear from me (Ducky) or even expect your character to be deleted.When you are in combat, you will automatically get an attack every 2 secondswhich is how often your heartbeat happens.  If for some reason, the monstershit you, but you do not hit back, try typing 'restart' which is the commandto restart your heartbeat.  Occasionally things go wrong and this will happenbut it isn't a common occurance so please tell a Ducky if you find a way ofmaking it happen.During combat, you can cast spells at the rate of 1 per heartbeat.  You mayfind some spells that can be cast instanta",})
