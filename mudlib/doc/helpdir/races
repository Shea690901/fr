Player races in the Forgotten Realms MUD:

Human: Most players will probably be human. They have no special advantages or
       disadvantages. Humans are the only race that has no guilds barred to 
       them.

Elf: Elves are a quick forest-dwelling race. They are more dextrous than humans,
     but are not as susceptible to pain. They are good at moving silently and
     somewhat better than humans with magic.

Half-elf: A halfblood human/elf.

Dwarf: Dwarves are a stout mountain-dwelling race. They are totally without 
       magical potential, but can be good clerics. Dwarves are much like the
       mountain they live in: Rock-steady and dour. They are generally quite
       good fighters.

Halfling: Halflings take their name from the fact that they are half as tall as
          humans. They are very dextrous and susceptible to pain, but are not
          very strong and world-wise.

Orc: Orcs are normally not considered to be a player race, but monsters. They
     are much the same way here: They are played as monster-players, meaning
     anyone who wants to kill them may try without fearing any punishment.
     Orcs are better at fighting than the other races. Many guild will refuse
     to train orcs bue to their vile nature.

Half-orcs: A halfblood human/orc. Half-orcs are not monster-players, but share
           some of the characteristics of orcs, meaning they are strong fighters
           but not very intelligent.
