QC doc to explain and guide through the STFG
--------------------------------------------
steps to see all the neat stuff:
1. set your guild to paladin or fighter
2. set your race to human (preferrably) but not anything hated by STF
3. go to STFG+"rooms/entrance.c"
4. go up (after looking around)
5. read the sign, get info and type "join"
   Lt. Vaughn will give you your rank insignia (STFG+"/handlers/rank_insignia.c"
6. You now are a member of the guard.  Look at yourself to see your rank.
7. Go down 2.  You are now in the barracks.  Type "recruit guards" to 
   receive your guards.
8. At this point look at your properties and your "head guard"'s props.  You
   will see that your properties keep track of your guards and score and
   your guards's props keep track of the point system, the pcs you have killed
   with the STFG killer prop and your point total.  The point total on your
   head guard changes every time you kill a monster that is part of the
   point system.  The point total on you only gets updated if you get your
   head guard back to Lt. Vaughn without dying.  This means that it is
   imperative that you keep your head guard alive to obtain higher ranks.
   For notes on the understanding the props wait until the end.
9. Next go to /w/raskolnikov/examples/demon_room.  You can kill him 3 times
   for 20 points apiece as indicated by the head guard's props.
10. After playing with my demon go back to Vaughn.  He will see if you 
    have earned a higher rank.  If you have you may also be eligible for
    more guards so go back to barracks and see.
11. Log in a test char and add the timed_prop("stormfront_guard_killer", 1, 500)
12. Go kill the test char.  Notice that your guards drag you into the fight and
    attack automatically.  After you kill him go back to Vaughn and he will
    give you your pay for keeping the streets of STF clean.

Thats about it for seeing some of the features.  Now the details:

-- The point system and bounty system is handled by
   STFG+"handlers/point_system_handler".  It keeps track of the mapping
   on the head guard and also contains the bounty system.  The rest of
   the eligible monsters will be added when Kodiak gets me more set_names.
   Every time a monster dies the head guard calls this handler to determine
   whether or not the monster is worth points.  The property mapings are
   explained within the code itself.  The bounty formula is victims level * 4
   plat plus bonuses of 20 if they are a hated race or in a hated guild.
-- The guards themselves are in STFG+"npcs/guard_sig and guard_sig_sec.
   Guard_sig is the basic guard and guard_sig_sec is the head guard or
   secretary.  Their level is equal to the players and their stats are
   determined by their levels.  They inherit STFG+"npcs/aggr_guards" which
   is a special version of the normal aggr_guards.  This file also 
   inherits the /obj/henchman.c code.
-- The rank insignia keeps track of the players rank and how many guards
   they get as well as initializing the props on the player.  See this file
   for explanation of the player props (STFG+"handlers/rank_insignia.c")
   This is also where the STFG+"handlers/henchcomms.c" is inherited so that
   the players can control their henchmen.  Hopefully this will be in
   /obj/handlers soon.
-- The barracks updates the guard number props on the player and uses them
   to determine if and when the player is eligible for more guards.  It 
   also sets up the henchman properly as they are cloned.
-- STFG+"npcs/vaughn.c controls all the joining and quitting as well as
   calling the point_system_handler to do its thing.

I am sure i have forgotten to outline some things but this should give you
a good idea what the STFG involves.  Any questions let me know.

Also a problem with the point system that I have not been able to 
solve is what happens when the head guard dies.  The point system
get re-initialized and the player can go kill what they already have
and get more points.  I could dump the monster part of the head
guard mapping prop on the player but it will be HUGE with over
a hundred monsters when im all done.  Any ideas?

-- Nevermind -)  I decided that the player loses any rank that he gained
   with the head guard that died.  Lt. Vaughn comes in and demotes the
   player when he goes to get another guard.  See do_demotion() in vaughn.
   The actual adjusting of the properties take place when the head 
   guard dies.  See do_death() in guard_sig_sec.  This means the player can
   go kill anything again that he killed with the head guard that just died
   but it doesnt take into account if this is his third, forth, etc. head
   guard.  The only way the player benefits is if the second head guard lasts
   a long time and then dies.  This means that he gets to go get all the same
   points again assuming he got back to vaughn just before the second guard
   died.  Its not perfect but I think its ok.
