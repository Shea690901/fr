 FR-mudlib version 2.1
 (c)opyright Final Realms 1995

 What you should do before you start coding new stuff..
 You can say we probably shuld have done some of this before releasing
 the mudlib, but it's just released because of a demand for it. 
 Mainly by our immortals that will use it for their testbed.

  - The directories baseobs/ and items/ are the same..
    It's even worse, in those there are armour/ and armours/
    and so on.. Decide upon what to use and remove the others.
    It's there because someone started using one and someone the other
    and stupid us, never set a standard (or rather, we changed it when some
    already had started using it)...

  - You should change the name of the mud. Since this mudlib isn't made
    with release in mind it's not just a define away. Those regarding
    the driver you probably already know about. 
    I guess grepping for fr-mud and final realms in global/,  secure/
    and the net/ directories will do most of the trick.

  - Change the name of the God character. You'll find the name in 
    secure/bastards.c, secure/master.c, secure/master.o and global/lord.c
  
  - Adding of more Demi+ should be done with the commands
    'call add_high_lord("name") /secure/master' and
    'call add_lord("name") /secure/master'
    After that, if the now demi shall be a God you have to edit 
   /global/lord.c and add || "name" in the query_god() function.

  - We have chosen to use the old 0.9.19.17 version of the MudOS driver
    this because the lib actually breaks a bit with newer versions.
    Read Whats_broken for help on what you can do.
