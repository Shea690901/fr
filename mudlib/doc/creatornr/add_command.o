nroffed_file ({0,"void add_command(string verb, object ob, string pattern)      Add command!!!  My favourite command.  How to use it.  This iswhat is used to drive all the 'read sign' things and so on.  Thiscoupled with the tempory_items in rooms makes things very cute.  Ok, howto call add_command and a quick description of what it does.Add_command is sort of like add_action in that it defines something youcan do.  The difference with add_command is that you need to have anobject to reference.  So you could not do the very 'say' usingadd_command because there are no object references involved.  Howeveryou can do read, etc because you have to read semething.  The objectpassed is the object upon which the verb will be defined, which objectyou wish to be called when the verb succeeds.  In most cases this willbe this_object, but you can do cute things....  The pattern varible isstring something like the form \"%D %p %I\", or \"%I %p %D\".  WHat does allthis gobbledy gook mean?  Well, %D means di",})
