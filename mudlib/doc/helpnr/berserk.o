nroffed_file ({0,"   BERSERK is a command usable by fighters only.  When a fighter goes berserk,  the following things happen. 1> The fighter gets massive bonuses to hit and damage with weapons only. 2> The fighter suffers a penalty to his/her Armour class. 3> The fighter attacks anything and everything living in every room he/she    passes through for as long as he/she is berserk. 4> The fighter's Guild Points go to 0, and do not begin recovering until    the fighter drops out of his/her berserk rage. 5> Upon dropping out of berserk rage, the fighter suffers a temporary loss    of constitution, while he recovers his strength.  PLEASE NOTE: If your    constitution goes below 0 due to this fatigue, YOU WILL DIE.   A major drawback to this is that a fighter cannot STOP being berserk, and will remain in a rage until he/she becomes tired.  The length of time a fighter stays berserk is dependant on how many Guild Points (GP) he/she had upon typing berserk.  Syntax: berserk",})
