nroffed_file ({0,"The LPC inherit statement:Syntax: inherit pathname;where pathname is a full path delimited by quotes (e.g. \"/std/Object\").The 'inherit' statement provides the inheritance capability (a concept fromobject-oriented programming) to LPC objects.  Inheritance lets an objectinherit functions and variables from other objects.  Because the MudOSdriverinternally stores global data and compiled code separately, many differentobjects can use inheritance to share the same piece of compiled code.  Each ofthese objects will have its own local copy of any global variables definedby the object.  Suppose that two object A and B inherit object C.  Recompilingobject either of A or B will not cause C to be recompiled.  However, it willcause any global variables provided by C to lose whatever data they had(remember that A and B each have their own copy of the global variablesprovided by C.  Thus updating A will not effect the global variables of B(even those provided by C) and vice versa)",})
