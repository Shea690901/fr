Final Realms mudlib
   Version 2.1

If you want to upgrade the driver, this will give you some idea of what
the problems are.

Basically the driver we released it with searches for any called function
from the outer layer of the inherit chain.

The new driver by default, searches from where it is "downhill".
The fix to this is to use this_object()->func(); instead of func();
in a few places.

The problem with fights stopping is due to a patch that was put in
in /std/basic (somewhere) to stop inanimate objects being attacked
grep fights will find it.

Silly things, but a reasonable number of them.
