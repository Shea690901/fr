As one might surmise from the name,LPC is based on the syntax of C.  LPC provides the C while loop, for loop,if statement, switch statement, a variant of sscanf, and integer data type,(LPC also provides other data types not in C such as the object and themapping).  LPC uses C's syntax for defining and calling functions and fordeclaring variables.  Note that LPC's version of the string datatype ismuch different from that provided by C.  See the LPC tutorial on syntaxand language constructs for more information.Here are some differences between LPC and C:There is no need for a function named \"main\" in LPC objects (although thereis one called \"create\").The efuns (or system calls) provided by the gamedriver are different thanthose typically found in the C library (libc.a).There is no malloc().  However, there is an allocate(int value) efun thatlets space be ",})
