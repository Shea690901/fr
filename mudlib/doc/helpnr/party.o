nroffed_file ({0,"Timion and Demifille are holding a Real-Life party for FR-MUD'ers:1>  The party is currently scheduled to take place over the weekend of July21, 1995  thru  July 24th, 1995, at Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas.  Timion andDemifille have a nice sized house, so there is pretty much room for everyone,as long as you don't mind sharing a piece of floor with your fellow FR'ers.2>  We are going to attempt to arrange a car-pool deal, where people drivingfrom remote locations can stop and pick up others on thier way, in exchangefor either a place to sleep for the night, or a share of the Gas money.  Ifyou want to attend, but can't find a ride, don't despair, just let us know.3>  When the time gets closer, we will be giving out directions to our home,more details, ect.  However, these will NOT be posted publicly (For obviousreasons), and you will have to contact either Demifille or myself (Timion)if you wish to attend.     Bill (Timion) & April (Demifille)",})
