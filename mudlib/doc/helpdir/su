Usage : su <name>

Su stands for switch user.  It will let you log in as a different person without
actually quitting from the mud and logging in again.  Effectively it will quit
you and then start logging you in as the name you specify.  It will then ask
for a password.  You can then just log in as normail.  For creators,
when you log in as your name, you are a player.  When you log in with a :
in front of your name, you are a creator.

Examples :

su ducky
su telsar
su :telsar (to log him on as creator)
