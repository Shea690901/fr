nroffed_file ({0,"Usage : ed <file/object>Ed is the editor that you can use from inside the mud.  Following is the listof commands that can be obtained from inside ed by typing 'h'.  The file youspecify will be expanded and if it matches to more than one file, the firstfile you specify will be used.  If the file cannot be written by you, it willalso print [read only].  Any changes you make, will not be saved if that is thecase.  Ed is very similar to ex and ed on unix machines so if you can finddocumentation for those commands, it will help you in ed.       Help for Ed  (V 2.0)---------------------------------     by Qixx [Update: 7/10/91]Commands--------/       search forward for pattern?       search backward for a pattern=       show current line numbera       append text starting after this lineA       like 'a' but with inverse autoindent modec       change current line, query for replacement textd       delete line(s)e       replace this file with another fileE       same ",})
